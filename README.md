# anitroxlegacy
Original Code for Nyabot/projectcanary, Now known as Anitrox/projectanitrox. This was created back in either late 2018 or early 2019 and my Discord.JS knowledge was way smaller then ðŸ˜›
# Requirements
node.js
Discord JS 11 (get it by running ``npm install discord.js-v11``
# This is considered DISCONTINUED and is unsupported, You won't be able to get support.
This uses Discord.JS v11 which is also unsupported and not recommended, Feel free to do whatever you want with this mess though.
# Want the new and modern Anitrox?
Well you can get it today! For the low low price of free you too can experience the amazing Anitrox!
